    <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
    <p>Lookly is a mobile application that provides AI-powered style advice based on user-uploaded photos and contextual information such as occasion, gender, age, and country. We prioritize your privacy and collect only the data essential for delivering core app functionality.</p>

    <h2>2. What Data We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device ID:</strong> Used solely to track whether a user has already received their first-time bonus coins (stored securely via Unity Cloud Save).</li>
        <li><strong>Image & Occasion Context:</strong> When you upload an image for style scoring, we send the photo and contextual details (occasion, gender, age, and country) to OpenAI’s API for temporary processing.</li>
        <li><strong>App Usage Data:</strong> We use Unity Analytics to collect anonymous data about how users interact with features (e.g., how many users generate a style score or view style tips).</li>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> If you choose to save your style score results, these are stored only on your device. We do not upload or back up this data to any server or cloud platform.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
