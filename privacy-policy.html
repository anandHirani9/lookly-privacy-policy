    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
        Lookly is a mobile application that provides AI-powered style advice based on user-uploaded photos and contextual information such as occasion, gender, age, and country. We prioritize your privacy and collect only the data essential for delivering core app functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>2. What Data We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device ID:</strong> Used solely to track whether a user has already received their first-time bonus coins (stored securely via Unity Cloud Save).</li>
        <li><strong>Image & Occasion Context:</strong> When you upload an image for style scoring, we send the photo and contextual details (such as the selected occasion, gender, age, and country) to OpenAI’s API for processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> If you choose to save your style score results, these are stored only on your device. We do not upload, back up, or store this data to any server or cloud platform.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Prevent multiple coin claims via the same device.</li>
        <li>Generate AI-powered fashion scores and suggestions.</li>
        <li>Improve the quality of feedback by tailoring responses to your input context.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. What We Do Not Do</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not store your uploaded images or input data on any server.</li>
        <li>We do not track your behavior across the app or across devices.</li>
        <li>We do not sell, share, or rent your personal data to any third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. AdMob and Rewarded Ads</h2>
    <p>
        We use Google AdMob to show rewarded video ads to users who choose to watch them in exchange for in-app coins.
        AdMob may collect data related to the ads shown to you, such as device identifiers, app usage, and interaction with ads. This data is used to deliver personalized ads and improve the ad experience.

    <ul>
        <li>We use Unity Cloud Save to store device ID and coin status.</li>
        <li>We use OpenAI API to analyze uploaded images and return style feedback. This process is stateless and does not retain any personal data on their end per OpenAI’s standard practices.</li>
